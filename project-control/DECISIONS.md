# DECISIONS — Uygunayakkabi

## D-001 — Core Storefront Stack
**Decision:**  
Use **Next.js** as the main storefront framework.

**Reason:**  
Need a flexible custom storefront that can grow into a more advanced system later.

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-002 — Admin / Backend Layer
**Decision:**  
Use **Payload CMS** as the admin and backend management layer.

**Reason:**  
Need a strong operational panel for:
- product management
- stock management
- pricing updates
- image/media handling
- future automation compatibility

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-003 — Shared Multi-PC Data Direction
**Decision:**  
Use a **shared cloud database approach** for multi-PC workflow.

**Reason:**  
Project is being developed from multiple machines and needs a central source of data.

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-004 — GitHub as Sync Backbone
**Decision:**  
Use **GitHub** as the main synchronization layer between development machines.

**Reason:**  
The project is developed across different PCs and requires a reliable shared code history.

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-005 — Admin Panel Role
**Decision:**  
The admin panel is not a temporary side tool; it is a core operational control center.

**Reason:**  
The business needs a place to manage:
- products
- stock
- pricing
- discounts
- images
- future automation-related actions

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-006 — Long-Term Automation Direction
**Decision:**  
The project should be built in a way that supports future automation layers.

**Reason:**  
Long-term direction includes:
- Telegram-based product intake
- AI-supported image workflows
- product creation automation
- publishing support for other channels

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-007 — Source of Truth Rule
**Decision:**  
Old chat conversations are **not** the main authority by default.

**Reason:**  
Chats may become outdated, fragmented, or partially solved.
The main authority should gradually move into structured files such as:
- PROJECT_STATE.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- DECISIONS.md

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-008 — Resolved Issues Rule
**Decision:**  
Previously solved technical problems should not be reintroduced as current truth unless they appear again.

**Reason:**  
Project discussions can repeat old issues even after they are fixed.
Current truth must always be checked against the latest project state.

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-009 — Phase-Based Build Strategy
**Decision:**  
The project will progress in structured phases rather than trying to build all systems at once.

**Phases:**  
- Phase 1: Core Admin System
- Phase 2: Automation Backbone
- Phase 3: Autonomous Content & Growth Layer

**Reason:**  
The automation and AI layers depend on a stable operational backend first.

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-010 — Telegram-First Commerce Operation
**Decision:**  
The long-term operational model of the business will be Telegram-first.

**Reason:**  
The goal is to manage product intake and publishing from the phone in a fast and practical way.

**Desired Flow:**  
Phone photo → Telegram bot → AI processing → product creation → website + Instagram + Shopier

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-011 — AI Product Image Workflow
**Decision:**  
Product image workflow should support enhancement and generation of additional product visuals while preserving product integrity.

**Requirements:**  
- original product should remain accurate
- background should not be incorrectly altered unless intentionally defined
- AI should generate additional usable product views
- final product should ideally have 3 images total

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-012 — Automated Multi-Channel Publishing
**Decision:**  
The system should be designed for automatic publishing across multiple channels.

**Target Channels:**  
- Website
- Instagram
- Shopier

**Reason:**  
The product publishing process should become centralized and low-friction.

**Status:**  
ACTIVE

---

## D-013 — Autonomous Blog / CEO Content Layer
**Decision:**  
The system should later include an AI-supported blog/content layer.

**Purpose:**  
- generate product-related definitions
- produce blog content from product data
- publish blog entries on site
- support organic traffic generation

**Status:**  
PLANNED-ACTIVE

---

## D-014 — Payload CMS Remains the Admin Direction
**Decision:**
Payload CMS remains the active admin/backend direction of the project.

**Reason:**
More recent implementation work, debugging, admin routing, collections, and media/admin structure are all built around Payload CMS.

**Status:**
ACTIVE

---

## D-015 — Initial Setup Problems Are Technical History, Not Current Truth
**Decision:**
Older setup-level issues should be preserved as technical history only, not as the current state authority.

**Examples:**
- early create-first-user failures
- early package/install conflicts
- early route/layout collisions
- initial empty importMap condition

**Status:**
ACTIVE

---

## D-016 — Phase 1 Requires Runtime Validation, Not Just Written Code
**Decision:**
Phase 1 is not complete when code exists on disk; both storefront and admin runtime must be tested and validated.

**Reason:**
Recent work shows that code changes may exist while runtime is still broken.

**Status:**
ACTIVE

---

## D-017 — Automation Starts Only After Admin + Storefront Stabilization
**Decision:**
n8n / Telegram / AI workflow work should begin only after both the storefront and the Payload admin side are stable enough to pass practical validation.

**Reason:**
Recent issues affected both storefront runtime and Payload admin rendering.

**Status:**
ACTIVE

---

## D-018 — Admin Is an Override / Control Layer
**Decision:**
The admin panel must act as an override/control layer over the same product data model that future automation will use.

**Reason:**
The project is being designed for future Telegram-first ingestion and automation compatibility.

**Status:**
ACTIVE

---

## D-019 — Product Model Must Stay Automation-Compatible
**Decision:**
The product system should remain compatible with future automation fields and sync logic.

**Suggested Concepts:**
- source
- updatedBy
- lastSyncedAt
- optional future lockFields

**Status:**
ACTIVE

---

## D-020 — Cloud-Friendly Media Direction
**Decision:**
Image handling should stay compatible with cloud/object-storage-friendly workflows rather than being tightly coupled to a final local filesystem strategy.

**Reason:**
The long-term system includes Telegram ingestion, automation, and likely cloud deployment.

**Status:**
ACTIVE

---

## D-021 — Telegram-First Commerce Vision Remains Core
**Decision:**
The long-term operating model of the business remains Telegram-first product intake and automation.

**Reason:**
The product publishing vision is based on phone-first operational speed and AI-assisted ingestion.

**Status:**
ACTIVE

---

---

## D-022 — Field Types Must Match DB Column Types Exactly
**Decision:** Payload field type changes that alter the underlying PostgreSQL column type are NOT safe via push when data exists.
**Constraint:**
- `type: ‘text’` → varchar (safe to keep)
- `type: ‘select’` → enum (changing existing text column to enum FAILS if existing data is invalid for enum)
- brand, category (products), size (variants): must remain `type: ‘text’` — DB columns are varchar
**Status:** ACTIVE — LOCKED CONSTRAINT

---

## D-023 — Existing Enum Values Cannot Be Changed Without Migration
**Decision:** Do not add or remove values from existing select fields in-place via push.
**Current safe enum values:**
- enum_products_status: active, soldout
- enum_customer_inquiries_status: new, contacted, completed
- enum_inventory_logs_source: telegram, admin, system
- enum_media_type: original, enhanced
**Status:** ACTIVE — LOCKED CONSTRAINT

---

## D-024 — .next Cache Must Be Cleared When Schema Push Behaves Unexpectedly
**Decision:** If Drizzle push tries to apply schema changes that contradict current collection definitions, the .next build cache is likely stale.
**Resolution:** Delete .next folder → restart server → push re-derives schema from fresh compiled code.
**Status:** ACTIVE — Known operational procedure
